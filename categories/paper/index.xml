      <description>Paper reading Abstract:  The first DL model to learn control policies from high-dimensional sensory input using RL; Model: CNN, trained with a variant of Q-learning; Input: raw pixels; Output: a value function estimating future rewards; Environment: seven Atari 2600 from ALE; Outperforms previous approaches on 6 games and surpasses a human expert on 3 games.  Introduction:   DL: able to extract high-level features from row sensory data
 Computer vision (AlexNet, Aerial Image Labeling, Pedestrain detection, etc.); Speech recognition; Q: Can similar techniques be beneficial for RL with sensory data?    Challenges for combining RL &amp;amp; DL:
 DL: large labelled data; RL: learn from sparse, noisy delayed scalar reward. DL: independent data samples; RL: highly correlated states. DL: DL: assume a fixed distribution; RL: data distribution changes as the algorithm learns.    Solution:</description>
